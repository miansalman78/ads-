This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## Backend Authentication Setup

The project now includes a lightweight Express server (`server/`) that handles JWT-based authentication with MongoDB.

### 1. Configure the API

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd server
   npm install
   ```
2. Create an `.env` file inside `server/`:
   ```ini
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/influencerapp
   JWT_SECRET=replace-with-a-strong-secret
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=3d
   ```
3. Start the API:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

### 2. Available endpoints

| Method | Endpoint             | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| ------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| POST   | `/api/auth/register` | Create a new user. Required fields: `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `password`. Optional: `userName`, `phoneNumber`, `brandName`, `role`, `country`, `state`, `currency` |
| POST   | `/api/auth/login`    | Authenticate and receive a JWT (`email`, `password`)                                                                                             |
| GET    | `/api/auth/me`       | Retrieve the current user (requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header)                                                                      |
| POST   | `/api/auth/resend-verification` | Trigger email verification flow (mock implementation). Requires `email`.                                                       |

Responses return both the `user` (without password hash) and a signed `token`. Passwords are hashed with `bcrypt`.

### 3. React Native integration

- API requests are centralized in `services/api.js` and `services/auth.js`.
- By default requests target your local backend (`http://192.168.100.194:5000/api`).  
  To point to a different backend (local/staging), set a global in `App.tsx` before rendering:
  ```js
  globalThis.__API_BASE_URL__ = 'https://your-backend/api';
  ```
- Authentication tokens are stored automatically after signup/login (`setAuthToken`). All subsequent requests include `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Successful login or registration automatically routes users to the correct dashboard based on their role (`brand` → `DashboardNew`, `creator` → `AppNavigator`).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
